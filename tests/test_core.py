"""Tests for torch_optim_introspection_guard.core.

These tests require torch to be installed (skipped otherwise, so this
package's own test suite -- and CI on both ubuntu-latest and
macos-latest -- degrades gracefully on a torch-less environment rather
than failing outright, matching how the CLI itself reports
TorchUnavailableError instead of crashing).

The regression test's independent oracle is NOT "trust core.py's own
diagnose() output" -- it is a from-scratch, hand-written repro identical
in spirit to the upstream issue's own minimal example but re-derived
here independently, run against three separate seeds, so a
future accidental revert of the guard implementation (e.g. someone
"simplifies" safe_get_optimizer_state_dict to only reset the step
counter instead of the full state) would be caught even if it happened
to still pass a single-seed check.
